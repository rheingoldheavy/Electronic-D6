The files in this repo are the Arduino Sketches and schematics used on the Electronic D6 Build page at www.rheingoldheavy.com

These files help build a small circuit that uses an Arduino Uno with a 74HC595 shift register to display the pattern of a six sided die on a series of 7 LED's.

There are two sketches...

  Electronic_D6                - the basic sketch based on a horizontal LED pattern layout.
  Electronic_D6_Revised_Layout - the basic sketch based on a clockwise LED pattern layout.
